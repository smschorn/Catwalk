# Catwalk Proposal  

## What is Catwalk?

Catwalk is your chance to show off your style by pulling together the best outfit possible...and walk the Catwalk!
Each round you'll have the opportunity to select articles of clothing for your model.
Each complete oufit will be scored, the better the outfit the more points you receive.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

1.  The first decision is whether the game should be one or two-player.
2.  A challenge will be to limit the scope of the game to a manageable level.
3.  I'd like to have (at least) options to select a top/blouse, bottom/pant and shoes.
4.  How to incorporate gender?


## Phases of Completion

1.  Create the framework of the game (Friday, 2/2, Saturday, 2/3 & Sunday, 2/4).
2.  Write logic for game progression, scoring, etc. (Sunday, 2/4 & Monday, 2/5).
3.  Source outfits and place within framework (Monday, 2/5 & Tuesday, 2/6).
4.  Refine experience / problem solve (Tuesday, 2/6 & Wednesday, 2/7).
5.  If time permits, add additional elements (ie, hats or accessories).
